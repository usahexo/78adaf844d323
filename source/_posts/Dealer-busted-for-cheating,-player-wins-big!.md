#  Dealer busted for cheating, player wins big!

It's not often that you hear about a casino dealer being caught cheating, but that's exactly what happened at the River Rock Casino in Richmond, British Columbia this week. According to reports, the dealer was caught stacking the deck in favour of a specific player, and as a result, that player walked away with a $77,000 windfall.

The incident took place on Sunday night and involved a blackjack game. The casino has refused to confirm or deny the identity of either the dealer or the player involved, but according to witnesses, things started to go badly for the dealer when they were caught stacking the deck.

One onlooker told local media that "it was pretty clear what was happening". The dealer had allegedly been dealing themselves an unfair advantage by stacking the deck in their favour. As a result, the player who was benefiting from this edge ended up winning big.

Casino security officials quickly stepped in and stopped the game, escorting the dealer from the premises. It's not yet clear what will happen to them, but they could face disciplinary action from their employer or even be criminally charged.

As for the lucky player who benefited from the dealer's cheating? They're probably still celebrating their big win. It's not every day that you walk away with over $75,000 in prize money without even having to risk your own money!

#  Should you hit on 16 when the dealer has Albania?

The answer to this question is actually yes, you should hit on 16 when the dealer has Albania. This is because if you hit, you have a better chance of getting closer to 21 than if you just stand. Additionally, the dealer may very well bust if they have Albania, so hitting is definitely the smarter move in this case.

#  Expert advice on how to beat blackjack when the dealer has Albania

<h2>Dealer has blackjack - how to beat the game</h2>

It can be tricky to beat blackjack when the dealer has blackjack, but there are some steps you can take to increase your chances of winning. Here are four expert tips:

1. Avoid splitting pairs. Splitting pairs is usually not a good idea when the dealer has blackjack, as you increase your chances of losing by splitting.

2. Double down on 10 and 11. If you have a 10 or 11, doubling down is usually a good move, as it increases your chances of winning by giving you another chance to hit.

3. Stand on 12 through 16. Straights and flushes are less likely when the dealer has blackjack, so it’s usually best to stand on hands that have a total of 12 through 16.

4. Hit on hands of 2 through 6. When the dealer has blackjack, it’s best to hit on hands that have a total of 2 through 6, as this gives you the best chance of getting closer to 21 without going bust.
