#  Is Nezha the Next Big Gamble for New Mexico?

New Mexico has long been known for its oil and gas production. However, with the rise of shale fracking, production in the state has exploded, making New Mexico one of the country’s leading producers of oil and gas.

Much of this new production is coming from the Permian Basin, a vast oil and gas field that straddles the border between Texas and New Mexico. And while much of the attention in the Permian Basin has been focused on Texas, there is no doubt that New Mexico is also benefiting from this boom.

In fact, some observers are now beginning to question whether New Mexico can keep up with Texas in terms of overall production. In particular, there is growing speculation that Nezha may be the next big gamble for New Mexico.

Nezha is a remote corner of New Mexico that sits atop a massive shale formation called the Wolfcamp Shale. The Wolfcamp Shale is said to contain as much oil and gas as the Bakken Formation in North Dakota, which has helped fuel that state’s fracking boom.

With estimates that the Wolfcamp Shale could contain up to 20 billion barrels of oil and natural gas liquids, companies are beginning to take notice. And while drilling has yet to commence in earnest in Nezha, there is no doubt that activity will pick up in coming years.

Already there are signs that Nezha is becoming an important player in New Mexico’s oil and gas industry. For example, just last month Chesapeake Energy announced plans to drill two wells in Nezha. And given all of the excitement surrounding Nezha, it is likely that more companies will follow suit in coming years.

So what does all of this mean for New Mexico? Well, on one hand it means more jobs and more economic growth for the state. But on the other hand it also means more risk. The fact is that drilling in Nezha is still relatively uncharted territory, and there is no guarantee that it will live up to its billing as another “Bakken-style” play.

In any event, it will be interesting to watch how things play out in Nezha over the next few years. If drilling proves successful then New Mexico could be looking at another major energy boom on its hands. But if things don’t go according to plan then it could be a major black eye for the state’s energy industry
