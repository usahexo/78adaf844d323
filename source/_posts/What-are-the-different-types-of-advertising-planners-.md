#  What are the different types of advertising planners? 

There are three types of advertising planners: the strategic, the tactical, and the operational. The strategic planner creates a broad, long-term plan for an advertising campaign. The tactical planner develops specific, short-term goals and plans to achieve them. And the operational planner oversees the day-to-day execution of an advertising campaign.

The strategic planner is responsible for creating a plan that will achieve the organization's desired results. They develop a deep understanding of the organization's goals and what advertising can do to help support them. They create a detailed plan that outlines how the organization will reach its target market, what messages it will communicate, what media it will use, and how much it will spend on advertising.

The tactical planner is responsible for developing specific goals and plans to achieve them. They work with the strategic planner to create short-term objectives that will help support the organization's long-term goal. They develop detailed plans for each phase of the advertising campaign, specifying what media should be used, which messages should be communicated, and how much should be spent on each element.

The operational planner is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day execution of an advertising campaign. They work with the tactical planner to put together a schedule for launching the campaign and make sure all the necessary resources are in place. They manage the budget and track results to make sure objectives are being met.

#  Who should create an advertising planner? 

When it comes to advertising, a well-planned campaign can be the difference between success and failure. A good advertising planner understands how to craft an effective campaign, identify the right audience, and reach them where they are most likely to see the ad. So, who should create this all-important document?

Most often, advertising planners are created in-house by marketing departments. However, if your company doesn’t have a marketing department or you need help crafting a specific campaign, you may want to consider hiring an advertising agency. An agency will have the experience and knowledge to help you create an effective ad campaign that reaches your target market.

When choosing an advertising agency, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure the agency has experience crafting campaigns for your industry. Second, ask for references from past clients. And finally, always contact the agency and ask for a proposal so you can see what services they offer and how much they charge.

Creating an effective advertising planner is critical for any business looking to reach new customers. By understanding who should create this document and what to look for when hiring an advertising agency, you’ll be on your way to creating a successful campaign that generates results.

#  How often should an advertising planner be reviewed/updated? 

The frequency at which an advertising planner should be reviewed and updated depends on a number of factors, including the type of advertising being planned, the size of the organization, and how quickly things change in the marketplace. In general, however, it's a good idea to review and update your advertising plan at least once a year.

If your organization is large and complex, with lots of different products and marketing channels, you'll likely need to review and update your advertising plan more often than once a year. Conversely, if your company is small and relatively stable, you may only need to review your plan every few years.

Regardless of how often you review your advertising plan, it's important to make sure that all members of your team are aware of any changes that have been made. This will help ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and that everyone is up-to-date on the latest marketing strategies.

#  What should be included in an advertising planner?

An advertising planner is a document that helps track and plan all aspects of an advertising campaign. Whether it’s for television, radio or online ads, a planner can help keep your messaging on track and make sure your budget is being well spent.

There are typically three main goals of any advertising campaign: to create awareness, to generate interest and to increase sales. Your planner should reflect these goals and track how each component of the ad campaign is helping to achieve them.

Some key components of an advertising planner include: 

 *Campaign Objectives: What are you trying to achieve with this ad campaign? 
*Target Audience: Who are you trying to reach with your message? 
*Channel Selection: What media will you use to deliver your message? 
*Budget: How much money do you have allocated for this campaign? 
*Timing: When will the campaign run? 
*Messaging: What is the core message of your campaign?

#  What are some things to consider when creating an advertising planner?

Creating an advertising planner can be a daunting task. There are many things to consider when developing an advertising plan. It is important to identify the advertising goals and objectives, target market, and strategies to reach the target market.

To start, you need to determine your advertising goals and objectives. What do you want your advertising to achieve? Do you want to increase brand awareness, generate leads, or sell products or services? Once you have identified your goals and objectives, you need to create a strategy for reaching your target market.

Who is your target market? Your target market is the group of people you are trying to reach with your advertising. You need to know their age, gender, geographic location, income level, and interests. Once you know who your target market is, you can develop ad campaigns that are most likely to reach them.

In addition to identifying your target market and developing ad campaigns, you also need to consider the media outlets that will best reach your target market. There are many different media outlets available today, including television, radio, the internet, magazines, and newspapers. You need to select the media outlets that will have the greatest impact on your target market.

It is also important to have a budget in mind when creating an advertising plan. How much money can you afford to spend on advertising? This will help determine which media outlets are most feasible for you.

Finally, it is important to track the results of your advertising campaign so that you can determine if it is achieving its desired results. By tracking the results, you can make changes as needed to ensure that your advertising campaign is successful.
