#  Gambling stocks, options down as investors weigh increased regulation

Gambling stocks were down on Monday morning as investors weighed the potential for increased regulation in the industry.

Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts and Las Vegas Sands were all down more than 3% in morning trading. Shares of Caesars Entertainment and Boyd Gaming, both casino operators, were down more than 5%.

Shares of online gambling companies, including PokerStars owner Stars Group and Winamax owner Playtech, were also down more than 3%.

The sell-off follows comments last week from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that he plans to introduce legislation targeting online gambling. McCarthy said the bill would "close a loophole" that allows gambling companies to operate outside of U.S. law.

Gambling stocks have been volatile in recent months as investors weigh the potential for increased regulation. In October, shares of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands plummeted after Reuters reported that the FBI was investigating allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn, the founder and former CEO of Wynn Resorts.

Wynn resigned from the company in February and has denied any wrongdoing.

#  Gambling stocks down as Supreme Court considers case to allow sports betting 

The stocks of gambling companies fell on Monday after the US Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could allow sports betting nationwide.

The case, which will be heard in the fall, centers on a ban on sports betting in most states. The plaintiffs argue that the ban violates the Constitution's anti-commandeering principle, which prohibits the federal government from forcing states to carry out its policies.

Shares of casino operators MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corporation both fell more than 5% on Monday. Shares of Boyd Gaming Corporation and Penn National Gaming, both of which operate casinos and racetracks, also fell sharply.

Gambling stocks had been rallying in recent months as investors bet that the court would rule in favor of the plaintiffs. The decision to hear the case came as a surprise to many analysts, who had expected the court to decline to hear the case.

If the court does rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it could open up a massive new market for gambling companies. Sports betting is currently estimated to be a $150 billion industry, but only a small fraction of that is legal.

#  Gambling stocks down on concerns of online gaming ban

The gambling stocks are taking a hit today, as investors fear that the Trump administration may soon ban online gaming. This would be a major blow to the industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.

The big players in the space include Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, and MGM Resorts. All of these stocks are down more than 5% on the news.

It's not clear exactly what the Trump administration is planning, but it seems that they are considering a ban on online gaming as part of a broader crackdown on internet gambling. This could have a significant impact on the industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.

Gambling stocks have been on a tear in recent years, as investors have been betting on strong growth in the industry. But it looks like that run may be coming to an end, as concerns about a potential online gaming ban increase.

There is no certainty that this ban will actually happen, but it's something that investors need to be aware of. If you're invested in any of the big gambling stocks, you may want to consider selling them off now, before they fall even further.

#  Options traders betting against gambling stocks

Some experts believe that a number of gambling stocks are overvalued and are ripe for a fall. options traders are betting against these stocks in increasing numbers.

According to Reuters, the short interest in MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts, Ltd., and Las Vegas Sands Corp. has surged in recent months. The short interest in MGM rose by more than 60% from mid-July to early September. For Wynn, the short interest increased by 33%. And for Las Vegas Sands, it jumped by 45%.

The reason for the increase in short interest is due to concerns about overvaluation. These gambling stocks have seen their share prices soar in 2017, with MGM up by more than 50%, Wynn up by nearly 60%, and Las Vegas Sands up by more than 80%.

Some market observers believe that this sharp increase is not warranted, especially as consumer spending on gambling has been declining in recent years. This was highlighted earlier this year when Steve Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts, said that "gambling in general is under pressure" due to competition from other forms of entertainment such as online gaming and sports betting.

This view was echoed recently by Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, who said that "gambling stocks are getting ahead of themselves" and that there is a "big risk of a pullback."

Given this backdrop, it's no surprise that options traders are betting against these stocks. The chart below shows the put/call ratio for MGM Resorts International (the black line) and Wynn Resorts Ltd. (the red line). As you can see, the put/call ratio has been rising for both stocks in recent months, indicating that more traders are buying puts (bets that the stock will fall) than calls (bets that the stock will rise).



      
   

It will be interesting to see if these gambling stocks continue to rally or if they succumb to the bearish sentiment among options traders.

#  Investors stay away from gambling stocks amid uncertainty

Investors have been avoiding gambling stocks in recent months as regulatory uncertainty affects the industry.

Shares of casino operators have been falling, with Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International and Las Vegas Sands all down by more than 10% in the past three months. The companies are suffering amid heightened scrutiny of their business practices by state and federal regulators. 

"It's just a very uncertain time for the industry," said gaming analyst Dennis Farrell Jr. of Chardan Capital Markets. "There are so many unknowns that investors would rather stay away."

The industry has come under fire in recent months after sexual misconduct allegations against executives at Wynn and Las Vegas Sands surfaced. New York's attorney general has also initiated an inquiry into whether the casinos offered illegal campaign contributions to help win favor with state officials.

"There is a lot of headline risk associated with these companies right now," said Brian McGill, an analyst with Macquarie Group. 

At the same time, there are concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, which could hurt demand for casino visits by wealthy Chinese tourists.

The regulatory environment is also becoming more challenging for the industry. The US Congress is considering a bill that would prohibit casinos from owning sportsbooks, a key source of growth for the industry in recent years. State legislators are also looking to strengthen regulations on casino operators.
