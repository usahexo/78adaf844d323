 ratings

This week, Golic and Wingo, ESPN Radio’s morning drive show, released their NFL preseason ratings for all 32 teams. Manchester City FC moved up four spots to number 21 overall. This comes on the heels of a strong performance in the pre-season where they went undefeated, scoring 18 goals and conceding only 3.

ESPN football analyst Steve Palazzolo had this to say about Manchester City:

"They have one of the best attacks in the league with Gabriel Jesus, Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sane and Bernardo Silva. Add in David Silva and John Stones and you have a very complete team. The question will be if they can stop teams from scoring as they gave up 51 goals last season."

The team’s high ranking this preseason is a good sign that they are poised for another successful year in the Premier League.

#  Manchester City FC Moves Up the Rankings with Golic and Wingo

Manchester City FC has been a powerhouse in the English Premier League for years. But, until recently, they have always seemed to lag behind their cross-town rivals Manchester United FC in terms of global popularity and rankings. That has all changed in the past few months with some high-profile signings and an incredibly successful season that culminated in a league championship and an appearance in the Champions League semifinals.

The turnaround began last summer with the signing of Pep Guardiola as manager. Guardiola is one of the most successful managers in world football, having won championships at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. He brought his innovative style of play to Manchester City, and it paid off immediately. The team made it to the semifinal of the Champions League, only to be narrowly defeated by eventual runners-up Real Madrid.

In January, Manchester City made a major signing by bringing in Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus from Palmeiras. Jesus had been one of the most sought-after young players in world football, and his arrival at Manchester City signaled their intent to win the Champions League.

This season, Manchester City was even more dominant, winning the Premier League with a record number of points. They also reached the final of the Carabao Cup (the English equivalent of America’s Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup), only to lose to Arsenal 3-0.

Their success has not gone unnoticed by global football rankings agencies. In recent months, Manchester City has climbed up the rankings, surpassing traditional powers such as Liverpool FC and Tottenham Hotspur FC. They are now ranked fourth in the world, behind only Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich.

This newfound success is thanks largely to Pep Guardiola’s innovation and ambition, as well as billionaire owner Sheikh Mansour’s willingness to invest heavily in the club. Manchester City is now one of Europe’s top clubs and is poised to make a serious run at winning the Champions League next season.
