#  Online casinos in Michigan - what is the best one for me?

Casinos have been around in Michigan since the early 1990s, and there are now a range of online casinos that Michigan residents can choose from. So, which one should you pick?

There are a few factors to consider when making your decision. The first is what type of games you want to play. If you’re a slots lover, then you’ll want to look for an online casino with a big selection of games. If you prefer table games such as blackjack or roulette, then make sure the casino has a good range of those too.
