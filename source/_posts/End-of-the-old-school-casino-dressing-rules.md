#  End of the old school casino dressing rules

The casino world is all about making money, and over the years, there have been a number of changes to make sure that casinos can make as much money as possible. One of the most noticeable changes has been to the dress code. In the old days, people had to dress up in order to enter a casino. However, in recent times, the dress code has become much more relaxed, with people now able to wear a wide range of clothing. This has made it much easier for people to visit casinos, and as a result, casinos have seen an increase in customer numbers.

There are a number of reasons why casinos have relaxed their dress code. The first reason is that casino owners realised that people don't like to feel uncomfortable. If people are forced to dress up, they will feel out of place and uncomfortable. This is not good for business, as people will be less likely to visit the casino again in the future. The second reason is that casino owners want to target a wider audience. By relaxing the dress code, they are able to attract people who might not normally visit a casino. This includes people who are not used to dressing up and those who live in colder climates where it is not always practical to wear formal clothing.

Despite the relaxed dress code, there are still some rules that need to be followed. For example, while you can wear denim jeans and T-shirts, you cannot wear shorts or sandals. And while you can drink alcohol in a casino, you cannot be too drunk or disorderly. These rules are in place to ensure that all guests in the casino are treated equally and fairly.

Overall, the relaxation of the casino dress code has been a positive move for both casinos and customers alike. It has made it easier for people to visit casinos, and as a result, casinos have been able to increase their profits.

#  Time to let your style take centre stage

We all have our own personal style and whether it’s dressing up or keeping things casual, we feel best when we can let it shine. So, this season, why not buy some new clothes that reflect your true personality?

There are so many great shops out there selling stylish clothes at affordable prices, so you don’t need to break the bank to update your wardrobe. And, if you’re not sure where to start, here are a few tips:

- Firstly, take some time to think about the styles that you usually like to wear. Do you prefer dresses or trousers? A smart blazer or a cosy cardigan? Once you’ve got an idea of the kind of look you’re going for, it will be easier to find clothes that fit with your style.

- Secondly, don’t be afraid to mix and match different styles. If you love wearing dresses but also like sporty clothes, why not buy a dress that has a sporty edge to it? There are no rules when it comes to fashion – just wear what makes you feel happy and confident!

- Finally, don’t be shy about trying something new. If there’s a style that you’ve always wanted to try but been too scared to go for, now is the time to give it a go. You may be surprised at how much you like it!

So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to let your true style shine through and find some great new clothes that reflect who you really are.
