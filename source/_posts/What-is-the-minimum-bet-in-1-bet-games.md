#  What is the minimum bet in 1 bet games?

In most one bet games the minimum bet is 1 unit. There are a few variations of this, such as in some craps games the minimum bet is 2 units, and in blackjack it can be as low as one dollar. The important thing to remember is that no matter what the game, the absolute minimum bet is 1 unit. Some casinos will let you go lower than this, but in general you don’t want to make a bet that’s any lower than 1 unit.

#  What are the maximum and minimum bets in 1 bet mobile?

There are a lot of different ways that you can gamble on your mobile device. One of the simplest ways is to place a bet on a single event. This can be done by betting on which team will win or by betting on the outcome of another type of event. The maximum and minimum bets you can make will vary depending on the sport or event that you are betting on, as well as the bookmaker that you are using.

When it comes to betting on a single event, there is no set limit to how much you can bet. Some bookmakers may have a higher limit than others, but in general there is no specific cap. This means that you could potentially bet hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a single event if you wanted to. However, it's important to remember that your chances of winning will decrease as your bets increase.

At the other end of the spectrum, there is also no minimum bet when it comes to single events. You could theoretically place a bet as low as one penny if you wanted to. However, most bookmakers will have a preset lower limit for bets, usually around $5 or $10. This is because processing smaller bets can be more costly for bookmakers and can also slow down the betting process overall.
