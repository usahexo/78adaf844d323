#  Trump and Clinton Clash in Final Debate Before Vegas Voting Begins

Clinton and Trump squared off in their third and final debate Wednesday night, just days before early voting begins in Nevada.

The 90-minute debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was a heated affair, with both candidates trading jabs on the economy, immigration and national security.

Trump came out swinging, accusing Clinton of being a "corrupt" politician who had been "unleashed" on the American people.

"She's lied to the American people," Trump said. "She's lied about emails. She's lied about Whitewater. She's lied about Benghazi. She's lied about so many things."

Clinton responded by saying Trump was "all talk, no action."

"Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger," Clinton said. "He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like."

The two also sparred over the Supreme Court, with Clinton warning that Trump would appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade and gut environmental regulations.

Trump hit back by accusing Clinton of wanting to raise taxes and expand government control of healthcare.

"She wants to go to Washington and raise taxes $1.3 trillion," Trump said. "She's going to increase regulation on small businesses, which will kill jobs."

The final debate was watched by an estimated 66 million viewers, making it the most-watched presidential debate in U.S. history.

#  Casino Workers Union Endorses Clinton Ahead of Showdown With Trump

In a show of support for the Democratic party's presumptive nominee, the casino workers union has endorsed Hillary Clinton. The endorsement comes ahead of the showdown between Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.

The union, which represents more than 10,000 casino workers in Atlantic City, says that Clinton has a proven record of fighting for working families. In addition, the union says that Clinton is the only candidate who can beat Trump in November.

"Donald Trump is a threat to our families and our economy," said Bob McDevitt, president of the casino workers union. "Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to stand up to Trump and protect our jobs and our communities."

This is not the first time that the casino workers union has endorsed a Democratic candidate. The union endorsed Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012.

#  Trump, Clinton to Face Off at Palace of Fine Arts in Vegas

After a year of campaigning, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are gearing up for the final showdown. The two candidates will face off at the Palace of Fine Arts in Las Vegas on Wednesday night.

Clinton is looking to build on her lead in the polls, while Trump is hoping to make a comeback. This will be their last chance to make their case to the American people before Election Day.

The debate is expected to be heated, with both candidates trading barbs. Clinton has accused Trump of being a "racist, sexist, homophobic liar," while Trump has called Clinton "corrupt" and "dishonest."

The stakes are high for both candidates. A win could give Clinton some momentum going into the final days of the campaign, while a loss could damage Trump's chances of winning in November.

It should be an exciting debate, and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.
