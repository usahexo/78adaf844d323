<p>The 90-minute debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was a heated affair, with both candidates trading jabs on the economy, immigration and national security.</p>
<p>Trump came out swinging, accusing Clinton of being a “corrupt” politician who had been “unleashed” on the American people.</p>
<p>“She’s lied to the American people,” Trump said. “She’s lied about emails. She’s lied about Whitewater. She’s lied about Benghazi. She’s lied about so many things.”</p>
<p>Clinton responded by saying Trump was “all talk, no action.”</p>
<p>“Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,” Clinton said. “He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don’t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like.”</p>
<p>The two also sparred over the Supreme Court, with Clinton warning that Trump would appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade and gut environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Trump hit back by accusing Clinton of wanting to raise taxes and expand government control of healthcare.</p>
<p>“She wants to go to Washington and raise taxes $1.3 trillion,” Trump said. “She’s going to increase regulation on small businesses, which will kill jobs.”</p>
<p>The final debate was watched by an estimated 66 million viewers, making it the most-watched presidential debate in U.S. history.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Workers-Union-Endorses-Clinton-Ahead-of-Showdown-With-Trump"><a href="#Casino-Workers-Union-Endorses-Clinton-Ahead-of-Showdown-With-Trump" class="headerlink" title="Casino Workers Union Endorses Clinton Ahead of Showdown With Trump"></a>Casino Workers Union Endorses Clinton Ahead of Showdown With Trump</h1><p>In a show of support for the Democratic party’s presumptive nominee, the casino workers union has endorsed Hillary Clinton. The endorsement comes ahead of the showdown between Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.</p>
<p>The union, which represents more than 10,000 casino workers in Atlantic City, says that Clinton has a proven record of fighting for working families. In addition, the union says that Clinton is the only candidate who can beat Trump in November.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is a threat to our families and our economy,” said Bob McDevitt, president of the casino workers union. “Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to stand up to Trump and protect our jobs and our communities.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the casino workers union has endorsed a Democratic candidate. The union endorsed Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Clinton-to-Face-Off-at-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-in-Vegas"><a href="#Trump-Clinton-to-Face-Off-at-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Trump, Clinton to Face Off at Palace of Fine Arts in Vegas"></a>Trump, Clinton to Face Off at Palace of Fine Arts in Vegas</h1><p>After a year of campaigning, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are gearing up for the final showdown. The two candidates will face off at the Palace of Fine Arts in Las Vegas on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Clinton is looking to build on her lead in the polls, while Trump is hoping to make a comeback. This will be their last chance to make their case to the American people before Election Day.</p>
<p>The debate is expected to be heated, with both candidates trading barbs. Clinton has accused Trump of being a “racist, sexist, homophobic liar,” while Trump has called Clinton “corrupt” and “dishonest.”</p>
<p>The stakes are high for both candidates. A win could give Clinton some momentum going into the final days of the campaign, while a loss could damage Trump’s chances of winning in November.</p>
<p>It should be an exciting debate, and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.</p>

<h1 id="From-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-to-Bellagio-A-Day-in-the-Life-of-the-Las-Vegas-Debate"><a href="#From-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-to-Bellagio-A-Day-in-the-Life-of-the-Las-Vegas-Debate" class="headerlink" title="From Palace of Fine Arts to Bellagio: A Day in the Life of the Las Vegas Debate"></a>From Palace of Fine Arts to Bellagio: A Day in the Life of the Las Vegas Debate</h1><p>A day in Las Vegas for the presidential debate is anything but ordinary. The schedule for the day is jam-packed with activities and events, starting as early as 7am and lasting until after midnight.</p>
<p>To start the day, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will have breakfast with their respective running mates. Clinton will have breakfast with Senator Tim Kaine at 9:30am at Saint Elmo’s Steakhouse in Burlington, VT, while Trump will have breakfast with Governor Mike Pence at 10:30am at the venerable Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the candidates will separately make their way to Las Vegas. Clinton’s plane is scheduled to touch down at 10:45am, while Trump’s is scheduled to arrive at 11:45am.</p>
<p>Once they arrive, they’ll begin their day with separate photo opportunities – Clinton at the iconic welcome sign and Trump overlooking the Las Vegas Strip. Then it’s off to their first campaign rallies of the day!</p>
<p>Clinton will hold her rally at noon at Canyon Springs High School in North Las Vegas, while Trump will hold his rally at 1pm at The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>After their rallies, it’s time for more photo ops! This time, they’ll be together – first appearing onstage together for the traditional pre-debate handshake and then taking a walk around the debate stage before finally sitting down for tonight’s showdown.</p>
<p>The 90-minute debate will begin at 9pm ET&#x2F;6pm PT and will be moderated by Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel. It will be broadcast live on all major networks as well as streamed online.</p>
<p>Immediately following the debate, both Clinton and Trump will give their post-debate speeches from their respective campaign headquarters – Clinton in Brooklyn, New York and Trump in Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>
