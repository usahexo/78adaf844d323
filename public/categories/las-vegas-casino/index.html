		<h1 id="Nevada-sees-largest-gambling-revenue-decline-in-history"><a href="#Nevada-sees-largest-gambling-revenue-decline-in-history" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sees largest gambling revenue decline in history"></a>Nevada sees largest gambling revenue decline in history</h1><p>The state of Nevada, which is traditionally known for its large gambling industry, has seen its gambling revenue decline more in the past year than at any other time in history. Experts say that there are a variety of factors contributing to this decline, including legalization of gambling in other states, the economy, and increased competition from casinos in neighboring states.</p>
<p>While the amount of money gambled overall has not changed much in recent years, the mix of where that money is being gambled has shifted. States like New Jersey and Pennsylvania have seen large increases in gambling revenue as people have moved away from Nevada. In addition, casinos in Las Vegas are facing increasing competition from Indian gaming facilities and other tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Nevada’s governor is hopeful that measures currently being considered by the legislature will help to revive the state’s gambling industry. These measures include increasing the limit on betting for some games and allowing table games at smaller casinos. However, it remains to be seen whether these or other measures will be enough to stem the tide of falling revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Clark-County-casinos-see-gambling-revenue-drop-by-15"><a href="#Clark-County-casinos-see-gambling-revenue-drop-by-15" class="headerlink" title="Clark County casinos see gambling revenue drop by 15%"></a>Clark County casinos see gambling revenue drop by 15%</h1><p>Gambling revenue in Clark County casinos dropped by 15% in 2018, as compared to 2017. This is the largest decrease in revenue in the past five years.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Nevada Gaming Control Board said that there are several reasons for this decline, including increased competition from other states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the legalization of gambling in neighboring states such as California.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also pointed to the fact that internet gambling has become more popular in recent years, and that many people are now choosing to gamble online rather than visit a casino.</p>
<p>In spite of this decrease in revenue, however, casino profits remain high. The average profit per casino was $7.3 million in 2018, a slight increase from the previous year.</p>
<h1 id="Regional-casinos-feeling-the-pinch-from-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Regional-casinos-feeling-the-pinch-from-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Regional casinos feeling the pinch from Las Vegas"></a>Regional casinos feeling the pinch from Las Vegas</h1><p>The popularity of Las Vegas as a gambling destination continues to take its toll on regional casinos, which are reporting declining profits and attendance.</p>
<p>Many economists point to the legalization of gambling in Nevada in 1931 as the start of the decline for regional casinos. Gambling had been outlawed in most states at the time, so Nevada became a popular destination for people looking to place bets.</p>
<p>As more and more states have legalized gambling, the appeal of Las Vegas has only grown. With resorts like The Venetian and The Bellagio, Las Vegas has something to offer gamblers of all budgets.</p>
<p>In addition, improvements in air travel have made it easier for people to get to Las Vegas. And with casino loyalty programs offering free or discounted flights, there’s even less incentive for people to visit regional casinos.</p>
<p>While some regional casinos are fighting back by expanding their offerings to include non-gambling attractions, such as restaurants and hotels, this may not be enough to stem the tide. As long as gambling remains popular, Las Vegas is likely to continue to siphon business away from smaller casinos.</p>
<h1 id="What-form-to-use-to-report-gambling-cutbacks-las-vegas-casino"><a href="#What-form-to-use-to-report-gambling-cutbacks-las-vegas-casino" class="headerlink" title="What form to use to report gambling cutbacks las vegas casino?"></a>What form to use to report gambling cutbacks las vegas casino?</h1><p>Casinos in Las Vegas are required to file a Form 5472 each year with the IRS. This form is used to report the Cutbacks in Gambling Revenue. What does this form look like and what information is required?</p>
<p>The Form 5472 is a four-page form that is used to report the Cutbacks in Gambling Revenue. The first page is for identifying information, such as the name and address of the casino, as well as the name and contact information for the person who prepared the return.</p>
<p>The second page is for reporting the amount of gross gambling income and associated deductions. This includes both cash and non-cash gambling income, as well as deductions for bad debts, depreciation, and amortization.</p>
<p>The third page is for reporting any foreign taxes paid on gambling income.</p>
<p>The fourth page is for signatures and other miscellaneous information.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-cutbacks-lead-to-layoffs-at-several-Las-Vegas-casinos"><a href="#Gambling-cutbacks-lead-to-layoffs-at-several-Las-Vegas-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Gambling cutbacks lead to layoffs at several Las Vegas casinos"></a>Gambling cutbacks lead to layoffs at several Las Vegas casinos</h1><p>Casinos in Las Vegas are taking measures to avoid gambling losses by laying off employees. This comes as a result of the state of Nevada cutting its gaming taxes.</p>
<p>The cuts were made in an attempt to keep businesses afloat in the city, which has been struggling in recent years due to falling tourism rates. In an interview with the Associated Press, one casino executive said that the layoffs would impact all areas of the casino, from dealers and cocktail waitresses to maintenance staff.</p>
<p>State legislators reduced the gaming tax rate from 6.75% to 6%. This is the first decrease in the tax rate in more than a decade. While it is hoped that this will help businesses, others are skeptical that it will be enough. The state’s resort industry has been hit hard in recent years, with a number of hotels and casinos closing down or filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Tourism officials are hopeful that things will start to turnaround this year, with visitation numbers increasing modestly by 2%. However, with new competition from destinations such as Maine and New Hampshire, it is uncertain whether or not Las Vegas will be able to reclaim its title as the top tourist destination in the US.</p>

<p>The 90-minute debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was a heated affair, with both candidates trading jabs on the economy, immigration and national security.</p>
<p>Trump came out swinging, accusing Clinton of being a “corrupt” politician who had been “unleashed” on the American people.</p>
<p>“She’s lied to the American people,” Trump said. “She’s lied about emails. She’s lied about Whitewater. She’s lied about Benghazi. She’s lied about so many things.”</p>
<p>Clinton responded by saying Trump was “all talk, no action.”</p>
<p>“Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,” Clinton said. “He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don’t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like.”</p>
<p>The two also sparred over the Supreme Court, with Clinton warning that Trump would appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade and gut environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Trump hit back by accusing Clinton of wanting to raise taxes and expand government control of healthcare.</p>
<p>“She wants to go to Washington and raise taxes $1.3 trillion,” Trump said. “She’s going to increase regulation on small businesses, which will kill jobs.”</p>
<p>The final debate was watched by an estimated 66 million viewers, making it the most-watched presidential debate in U.S. history.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Workers-Union-Endorses-Clinton-Ahead-of-Showdown-With-Trump"><a href="#Casino-Workers-Union-Endorses-Clinton-Ahead-of-Showdown-With-Trump" class="headerlink" title="Casino Workers Union Endorses Clinton Ahead of Showdown With Trump"></a>Casino Workers Union Endorses Clinton Ahead of Showdown With Trump</h1><p>In a show of support for the Democratic party’s presumptive nominee, the casino workers union has endorsed Hillary Clinton. The endorsement comes ahead of the showdown between Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.</p>
<p>The union, which represents more than 10,000 casino workers in Atlantic City, says that Clinton has a proven record of fighting for working families. In addition, the union says that Clinton is the only candidate who can beat Trump in November.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is a threat to our families and our economy,” said Bob McDevitt, president of the casino workers union. “Hillary Clinton is the best candidate to stand up to Trump and protect our jobs and our communities.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the casino workers union has endorsed a Democratic candidate. The union endorsed Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Clinton-to-Face-Off-at-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-in-Vegas"><a href="#Trump-Clinton-to-Face-Off-at-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Trump, Clinton to Face Off at Palace of Fine Arts in Vegas"></a>Trump, Clinton to Face Off at Palace of Fine Arts in Vegas</h1><p>After a year of campaigning, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are gearing up for the final showdown. The two candidates will face off at the Palace of Fine Arts in Las Vegas on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Clinton is looking to build on her lead in the polls, while Trump is hoping to make a comeback. This will be their last chance to make their case to the American people before Election Day.</p>
<p>The debate is expected to be heated, with both candidates trading barbs. Clinton has accused Trump of being a “racist, sexist, homophobic liar,” while Trump has called Clinton “corrupt” and “dishonest.”</p>
<p>The stakes are high for both candidates. A win could give Clinton some momentum going into the final days of the campaign, while a loss could damage Trump’s chances of winning in November.</p>
<p>It should be an exciting debate, and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.</p>

<p>The 90-minute debate will begin at 9pm ET&#x2F;6pm PT and will be moderated by Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel. It will be broadcast live on all major networks as well as streamed online.</p>
<p>Immediately following the debate, both Clinton and Trump will give their post-debate speeches from their respective campaign headquarters – Clinton in Brooklyn, New York and Trump in Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>
