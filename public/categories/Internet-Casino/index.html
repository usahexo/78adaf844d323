Here’s a guide on how to do just that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete all of your online gambling account details</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to delete all of your online gambling account details. This includes usernames, passwords and any other information that could be used to access your accounts.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Remove all traces of gambling from your computer</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, you’ll need to remove all traces of gambling from your computer. This includes deleting any bookmarks, files or folders related to gambling websites. You should also clear your internet history and cookies.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Block all gambling websites</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it’s time to block all gambling websites. You can do this by using a browser extension such as Betfilter, Gamban or Gambling Blocker. These extensions will prevent you from visiting any gambling websites, thus preventing you from temptation.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Cancel or freeze all of your credit&#x2F;debit cards</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any credit or debit cards linked to your online gambling accounts, you’ll need to cancel or freeze them. This will stop you from being able to make any further deposits or withdrawals.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Inform family and friends about your decision</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it’s important to tell your family and friends about your decision to ban yourself from online gambling. This will help keep you accountable and ensure that you don’t relapse.</p>
<h1 id="The-easy-way-to-block-yourself-from-online-gambling-sites"><a href="#The-easy-way-to-block-yourself-from-online-gambling-sites" class="headerlink" title="The easy way to block yourself from online gambling sites!"></a>The easy way to block yourself from online gambling sites!</h1><p>There are a few different ways that you can go about blocking yourself from online gambling sites, but we’re going to show you the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>The first thing you’re going to want to do is download and install the software called CyberSitter. CyberSitter is a program that will allow you to block certain websites from your computer. You can find it at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cybersitter.com/">www.cybersitter.com</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have CyberSitter installed, open it up and click on the “Add Website Blockers” tab. From there, click on the “Gambling” category and then select the websites that you want to block.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! Now, when you try to visit any of the websites that you blocked, you will be automatically redirected to a page that says “This website has been blocked by CyberSitter.”</p>
<h1 id="Simple-tips-to-help-you-avoid-temptation-and-stop-gambling-online"><a href="#Simple-tips-to-help-you-avoid-temptation-and-stop-gambling-online" class="headerlink" title="Simple tips to help you avoid temptation and stop gambling online!"></a>Simple tips to help you avoid temptation and stop gambling online!</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and enjoyable experience, but for some people it can become an addiction that leads to serious financial problems. If you’re worried about your gambling habits or feel like you’re struggling to control them, read on for some simple tips that can help you avoid temptation and stay on track.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set limits and stick to them</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to avoid getting into trouble with gambling is to set limits on how much you’re allowed to wager and then stick to them. This might mean deciding beforehand how much money you’re comfortable spending in one session, or how many bets you’ll make in a row. Whatever your limit is, be sure to stick to it!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t gamble when you’re feeling stressed or upset</li>
</ol>
<p>When we’re feeling down or stressed out, we can be more likely to take risks and make reckless decisions. This is definitely true when it comes to gambling, so if you’re feeling overwhelmed or emotional, it’s best to take a break until you’re in a better place mentally.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Get help if you need it</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel like your gambling is spiraling out of control and becoming a problem, don’t be afraid to reach out for help. Talk to someone close to you about your concerns, or seek professional counseling if necessary. There is no shame in getting help when it comes to dealing with addiction, so don’t hesitate to ask for assistance if you need it.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-sure-you-never-gamble-on-the-internet-again"><a href="#How-to-make-sure-you-never-gamble-on-the-internet-again" class="headerlink" title="How to make sure you never gamble on the internet again!"></a>How to make sure you never gamble on the internet again!</h1><p>You may be asking yourself, “How can I make sure that I never gamble on the internet again?” Well, you’ve come to the right place! Here are a few simple tips to help ensure that you never have to worry about gambling on the internet again!</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important to remember that gambling can be addictive. So if you find yourself starting to spend too much time gambling on the internet, or if you’re finding yourself unable to resist temptation, it might be time to take a break from online gambling altogether.</p>
<p>Secondly, always make sure you’re gambling with money that you can afford to lose. Gambling should never be considered a way to make money – it’s a risky game that can often lead to losses. So if you’re sticking to this rule, it’ll be much harder for you to lose more money than you can afford.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to set some limits for yourself when it comes to gambling. For example, decide how much money you’re comfortable betting each day or each week, and stick to those limits. That way, you’ll never find yourself in a situation where you’re risking too much money on one bet.</p>
<p>If you follow these tips, you’ll be well on your way to avoiding any potential problems with online gambling. So don’t wait – start following these guidelines today and enjoy a safe and healthy online gambling experience for years to come!</p>

		<h1 id="Gambling-stocks-and-options-face-uncertainty-with-new-regulation"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-and-options-face-uncertainty-with-new-regulation" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks and options face uncertainty with new regulation"></a>Gambling stocks and options face uncertainty with new regulation</h1><p>Investors in gambling stocks and options are facing an uncertain future, as new regulation looms that could restrict or even ban the industry.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no solid indication of what the final legislation will look like, or when it will be passed. However, there is a growing consensus among lawmakers that some form of regulation is needed to protect consumers from the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is causing a lot of volatility in the share prices of gambling companies, and it’s unclear how much longer this situation will continue. If the final legislation is very restrictive, it could have a significant impact on these companies’ businesses and earnings.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is also having an effect on options prices. The implied volatility for gambling stocks and options has been rising in recent months, as investors try to anticipate the potential outcomes of the new regulation.</p>
<p>So what should investors do in this situation? If you’re invested in gambling stocks or options, it’s important to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments related to the new regulation. Monitor how the shares and options are reacting to any news or rumours about the regulation, and be prepared to sell if things take a turn for the worse.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-stocks-hit-as-investors-pull-out-of-the-market"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-hit-as-investors-pull-out-of-the-market" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks hit as investors pull out of the market"></a>Gambling stocks hit as investors pull out of the market</h1><p>Investors are pulling out of the gambling stocks market as concerns over the industry’s future mount.</p>
<p>The sector has suffered amid fears that the explosion of online gaming will see a sharp decline in revenue for bricks-and-mortar casinos.</p>
<p>Shares in casino operators such as Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International and Las Vegas Sands have all fallen in recent months.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts has seen its stock price fall by more than 30% since January, while MGM Resorts is down by more than 20%.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands is down by almost 15%.</p>
<h1 id="Investors-brace-for-gambling-industry-crackdown"><a href="#Investors-brace-for-gambling-industry-crackdown" class="headerlink" title="Investors brace for gambling industry crackdown"></a>Investors brace for gambling industry crackdown</h1><p>Investors in the gambling industry are bracing themselves for a crackdown by the Chinese government. Officials are said to be concerned about the social and economic costs of gambling, and are considering new regulations to restrict the industry.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the government has cracked down on gambling: a previous attempt in 2004 was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, investors are worried that this latest crackdown could have a significant impact on their businesses.</p>
<p> Macau, which is the world’s biggest gambling hub, is particularly vulnerable. The territory’s economy is heavily reliant on gambling revenues, and any restrictions on the industry could have a devastating effect.</p>
<p>Many casino operators have already announced plans to reduce their presence in Macau, and some are even considering leaving the market altogether. This could lead to a decline in property prices and an increase in unemployment in the territory.</p>
<p>The crackdown is also expected to have a negative impact on other Asian countries that rely on gambling revenue, such as South Korea and Vietnam. These countries have been enjoying strong growth in recent years, but this could come to an end if Chinese officials impose stricter regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-stocks-slump-as-Senate-talks-gambling-reform"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-slump-as-Senate-talks-gambling-reform" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks slump as Senate talks gambling reform"></a>Gambling stocks slump as Senate talks gambling reform</h1><p>The stocks of major gambling companies fell yesterday as the Senate began discussing a bill to reform the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would restrict online gambling, ban certain types of betting, and end the practice of “pay to play” in which casinos provide special deals to high-rollers.</p>
<p>Shares of Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts, and other gaming companies tumbled on the news, with Wynn losing 7% and MGM dropping 5%.</p>
<p>The gambling industry has come under fire in recent years for its links to organised crime and money laundering. The proposed bill is seen as a way to curb these activities and protect consumers.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say it will cost jobs and reduce tax revenue from the gambling industry. They argue that the current system is working well and should be left alone.</p>
<p>The Senate is expected to vote on the bill in the coming weeks.</p>
<h1 id="Wall-Street-reacts-to-reports-of-looming-gambling-regulation"><a href="#Wall-Street-reacts-to-reports-of-looming-gambling-regulation" class="headerlink" title="Wall Street reacts to reports of looming gambling regulation"></a>Wall Street reacts to reports of looming gambling regulation</h1><p>As the news of potential gambling regulation spreads, Wall Street is reacting with mixed sentiment.</p>
<p>Shares of many gambling companies are up, as investors anticipate a more favorable regulatory environment. But other stocks, such as casino operators and hoteliers, are down as investors worry about the potential impact on their businesses.</p>
<p>Analysts are trying to figure out what the eventual regulations will look like, and how they will affect different sectors of the gambling industry.</p>
<p>There is broad consensus that online gambling will be legalized and regulated, but there is disagreement about whether brick-and-mortar casinos will continue to be allowed. Some believe that the market for brick-and-mortar casinos is saturated, and that younger Americans prefer to gamble online.</p>
<p>Others believe that casinos will continue to be popular, especially in states where there is already a strong casino industry. They argue that casinos offer social and entertainment value that cannot be replicated online.</p>
<p>Hoteliers are also concerned about how potential regulation will affect their business. With fewer people visiting Las Vegas and other gaming destinations, operators may have to offer lower room rates and other discounts in order to stay competitive.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how these industries will ultimately be affected by the looming regulation. In the meantime, Wall Street is reacting cautiously, waiting for more details about what the new landscape will look like.</p>

		<h1 id="Gambling-stocks-options-down-as-investors-weigh-increased-regulation"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-options-down-as-investors-weigh-increased-regulation" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks, options down as investors weigh increased regulation"></a>Gambling stocks, options down as investors weigh increased regulation</h1><p>Gambling stocks were down on Monday morning as investors weighed the potential for increased regulation in the industry.</p>
<p>Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts and Las Vegas Sands were all down more than 3% in morning trading. Shares of Caesars Entertainment and Boyd Gaming, both casino operators, were down more than 5%.</p>
<p>Shares of online gambling companies, including PokerStars owner Stars Group and Winamax owner Playtech, were also down more than 3%.</p>
<p>The sell-off follows comments last week from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that he plans to introduce legislation targeting online gambling. McCarthy said the bill would “close a loophole” that allows gambling companies to operate outside of U.S. law.</p>
<p>Gambling stocks have been volatile in recent months as investors weigh the potential for increased regulation. In October, shares of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands plummeted after Reuters reported that the FBI was investigating allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn, the founder and former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p>
<p>Wynn resigned from the company in February and has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-stocks-down-as-Supreme-Court-considers-case-to-allow-sports-betting"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-down-as-Supreme-Court-considers-case-to-allow-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks down as Supreme Court considers case to allow sports betting"></a>Gambling stocks down as Supreme Court considers case to allow sports betting</h1><p>The stocks of gambling companies fell on Monday after the US Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could allow sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>The case, which will be heard in the fall, centers on a ban on sports betting in most states. The plaintiffs argue that the ban violates the Constitution’s anti-commandeering principle, which prohibits the federal government from forcing states to carry out its policies.</p>
<p>Shares of casino operators MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corporation both fell more than 5% on Monday. Shares of Boyd Gaming Corporation and Penn National Gaming, both of which operate casinos and racetracks, also fell sharply.</p>
<p>Gambling stocks had been rallying in recent months as investors bet that the court would rule in favor of the plaintiffs. The decision to hear the case came as a surprise to many analysts, who had expected the court to decline to hear the case.</p>
<p>If the court does rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it could open up a massive new market for gambling companies. Sports betting is currently estimated to be a $150 billion industry, but only a small fraction of that is legal.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-stocks-down-on-concerns-of-online-gaming-ban"><a href="#Gambling-stocks-down-on-concerns-of-online-gaming-ban" class="headerlink" title="Gambling stocks down on concerns of online gaming ban"></a>Gambling stocks down on concerns of online gaming ban</h1><p>The gambling stocks are taking a hit today, as investors fear that the Trump administration may soon ban online gaming. This would be a major blow to the industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.</p>
<p>The big players in the space include Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, and MGM Resorts. All of these stocks are down more than 5% on the news.</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly what the Trump administration is planning, but it seems that they are considering a ban on online gaming as part of a broader crackdown on internet gambling. This could have a significant impact on the industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.</p>
<p>Gambling stocks have been on a tear in recent years, as investors have been betting on strong growth in the industry. But it looks like that run may be coming to an end, as concerns about a potential online gaming ban increase.</p>
<p>There is no certainty that this ban will actually happen, but it’s something that investors need to be aware of. If you’re invested in any of the big gambling stocks, you may want to consider selling them off now, before they fall even further.</p>
<h1 id="Options-traders-betting-against-gambling-stocks"><a href="#Options-traders-betting-against-gambling-stocks" class="headerlink" title="Options traders betting against gambling stocks"></a>Options traders betting against gambling stocks</h1><p>Some experts believe that a number of gambling stocks are overvalued and are ripe for a fall. options traders are betting against these stocks in increasing numbers.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the short interest in MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts, Ltd., and Las Vegas Sands Corp. has surged in recent months. The short interest in MGM rose by more than 60% from mid-July to early September. For Wynn, the short interest increased by 33%. And for Las Vegas Sands, it jumped by 45%.</p>
<p>The reason for the increase in short interest is due to concerns about overvaluation. These gambling stocks have seen their share prices soar in 2017, with MGM up by more than 50%, Wynn up by nearly 60%, and Las Vegas Sands up by more than 80%.</p>
<p>Some market observers believe that this sharp increase is not warranted, especially as consumer spending on gambling has been declining in recent years. This was highlighted earlier this year when Steve Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts, said that “gambling in general is under pressure” due to competition from other forms of entertainment such as online gaming and sports betting.</p>
<p>This view was echoed recently by Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, who said that “gambling stocks are getting ahead of themselves” and that there is a “big risk of a pullback.”</p>
<p>Given this backdrop, it’s no surprise that options traders are betting against these stocks. The chart below shows the put&#x2F;call ratio for MGM Resorts International (the black line) and Wynn Resorts Ltd. (the red line). As you can see, the put&#x2F;call ratio has been rising for both stocks in recent months, indicating that more traders are buying puts (bets that the stock will fall) than calls (bets that the stock will rise).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if these gambling stocks continue to rally or if they succumb to the bearish sentiment among options traders.</p>
<h1 id="Investors-stay-away-from-gambling-stocks-amid-uncertainty"><a href="#Investors-stay-away-from-gambling-stocks-amid-uncertainty" class="headerlink" title="Investors stay away from gambling stocks amid uncertainty"></a>Investors stay away from gambling stocks amid uncertainty</h1><p>Investors have been avoiding gambling stocks in recent months as regulatory uncertainty affects the industry.</p>
<p>Shares of casino operators have been falling, with Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International and Las Vegas Sands all down by more than 10% in the past three months. The companies are suffering amid heightened scrutiny of their business practices by state and federal regulators. </p>
<p>“It’s just a very uncertain time for the industry,” said gaming analyst Dennis Farrell Jr. of Chardan Capital Markets. “There are so many unknowns that investors would rather stay away.”</p>
<p>The industry has come under fire in recent months after sexual misconduct allegations against executives at Wynn and Las Vegas Sands surfaced. New York’s attorney general has also initiated an inquiry into whether the casinos offered illegal campaign contributions to help win favor with state officials.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of headline risk associated with these companies right now,” said Brian McGill, an analyst with Macquarie Group. </p>
<p>At the same time, there are concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, which could hurt demand for casino visits by wealthy Chinese tourists.</p>
<p>The regulatory environment is also becoming more challenging for the industry. The US Congress is considering a bill that would prohibit casinos from owning sportsbooks, a key source of growth for the industry in recent years. State legislators are also looking to strengthen regulations on casino operators.</p>
