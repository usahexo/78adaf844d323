In addition, you will need to be able to work with clients, understand their needs and wants, and develop creative solutions that meet their expectations.</p>
<p>You should also be familiar with the Russian advertising market and regulations, as well as have excellent writing and communication skills. Being fluent in Russian is a plus, but it is not essential.</p>
<p>To get started, you can search for job openings on websites like Indeed.com or find agencies in your area that may be hiring. You can also network with people working in the advertising industry to learn more about the field and get advice on how to break into it.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about advertising and have the necessary skills, then becoming an advertising planner is a great way to build a successful career in Russia.</p>
<h1 id="What-qualifications-are-necessary-to-become-an-advertising-planner-in-an-advertising-agency-in-Russia"><a href="#What-qualifications-are-necessary-to-become-an-advertising-planner-in-an-advertising-agency-in-Russia" class="headerlink" title="What qualifications are necessary to become an advertising planner in an advertising agency in Russia?"></a>What qualifications are necessary to become an advertising planner in an advertising agency in Russia?</h1><p>Most people would think that in order to work in advertising you must have a background in art. This is not always the case. There are many different ways to enter the advertising industry. A common path is to first study marketing and then specialize in advertising. However, there are other routes that can also lead to a successful career in advertising.</p>
<p>One such route is to become an advertising planner. An advertising planner’s job is to develop creative ideas for advertisements and come up with strategies for their campaigns. In order to do this, they must have a good understanding of both the advertising world and the client’s business. They must also be able to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions to problems.</p>
<p>In Russia, the qualifications necessary to become an advertising planner are a degree in marketing or media studies and at least two years of experience working in an advertising agency. However, some positions may require more experience or specialist knowledge. For example, a planner working on digital campaigns may need skills in web development or programming.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-role-of-the-advertising-planner-in-an-advertising-agency-in-Russia"><a href="#What-is-the-role-of-the-advertising-planner-in-an-advertising-agency-in-Russia" class="headerlink" title="What is the role of the advertising planner in an advertising agency in Russia?"></a>What is the role of the advertising planner in an advertising agency in Russia?</h1><p>The Russian advertising market is one of the most advanced and fast-growing in the world. In 2017, it was worth $7.5 billion and is expected to reach $9.5 billion by 2020, according to data from ZenithOptimedia.</p>
<p>This growth has not gone unnoticed by international brands and advertising agencies alike, which are increasingly looking to establish a presence in Russia. The role of the advertising planner within these agencies is therefore vital in ensuring that campaigns are well executed and achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>A typical day for an advertising planner in Russia might involve working on briefs from clients, liaising with teams of creatives and media planners, managing budgets, and monitoring campaign performance. They must also be able to think creatively and have a good understanding of both Russian culture and the latest trends in advertising.</p>
<p>Since the Russian advertising market is becoming increasingly competitive, it is essential for advertising planners to be skilled in project management and have a good knowledge of digital marketing tools and techniques.</p>

The main responsibilities of the advertising planner are to develop strategies for advertising campaigns and to create and oversee advertising schedules. The advertising planner also coordinates with account executives, creative directors, and other staff within the agency to ensure that all elements of an ad campaign work together.</p>
<p>The main goal of the advertising planner is to create advertisements that will generate interest in the product or service being promoted and that will lead to increased sales. In order to achieve this goal, the advertising planner must have a good understanding of how different types of ads work, what appeals to consumers, and what media outlets are most likely to reach the target audience.</p>
<p>The advertising planner must also be familiar with the regulations governing advertising in Russia. In addition, the planner must be able to track results and determine whether or not the ad campaign was effective. If not, adjustments may need to be made for future campaigns.</p>
