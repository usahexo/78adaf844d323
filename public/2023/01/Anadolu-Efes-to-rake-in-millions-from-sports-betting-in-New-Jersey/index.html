The club has agreed a deal with Monmouth Park Racetrack, a horse racing track in New Jersey, which will see Anadolu Efes receive a percentage of all bets placed on its games.</p>
<p>The deal is Anadolu Efes’ first foray into the world of sports betting, and is expected to bring the club millions of dollars over the next few years. The agreement will also see Monmouth Park Racetrack promote Anadolu Efes’ games to its customers, with the aim of boosting betting numbers.</p>
<p>“This landmark alliance gives us an incredible opportunity to tap into the fast-growing U.S. sports betting market,” said Hasan Salihamidzic, Anadolu Efes’ president. “It also allows us to further strengthen our brand and presence in key global markets.”</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is not the only club to have struck a deal with a U.S. gambling company; several European clubs have done so in recent months. However, the agreement with Monmouth Park Racetrack is thought to be one of the most lucrative yet.</p>
<p>The news comes as U.S. states continue to liberalize their gambling laws in an effort to boost tourism and tax revenue. In May this year, New Jersey became the first state to allow online gambling, and other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-sports-books-optimistic-about-Anadolu-Efes-earnings"><a href="#NJ-sports-books-optimistic-about-Anadolu-Efes-earnings" class="headerlink" title="NJ sports books optimistic about Anadolu Efes earnings"></a>NJ sports books optimistic about Anadolu Efes earnings</h1><p>NJ sports books are optimistic about Anadolu Efes, a Turkish professional basketball club based in Istanbul, following their strong performance in the EuroLeague.</p>
<p>The team – which has won the Turkish Basketball Super League championship six times and the EuroLeague championship once – is coming off a successful 2017-2018 season in which they placed first in their group and reached the Final Four. Their success has NJ sportsbooks taking note, with some projecting the team to make a significant run in this year’s tournament.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is scheduled to play four games over the next week as they start their campaign in this year’s EuroLeague. The team is set to take on Fenerbahçe Ülker of Istanbul on Wednesday, September 26, Olympiacos Piraeus of Greece on Thursday, September 27, Barcelona Lassa of Spain on Sunday, September 30, and Khimki Moscow Region of Russia on Tuesday, October 2.</p>
<p>The odds for Anadolu Efes to win the EuroLeague title have been set at +5000 at NJ sportsbooks such as Play SugarHouse. This puts them behind only several other teams including CSKA Moscow (+1400), Real Madrid (+1600), FC Barcelona Lassa (+2000), and Maccabi Tel Aviv (+2200).</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe Ülker is considered the early favorite to win this year’s tournament at NJ sportsbooks, with odds of -225. They are followed by CSKA Moscow (+325), Real Madrid (+350), FC Barcelona Lassa (+750), and Maccabi Tel Aviv (+800).</p>
<h1 id="Increased-Anadolu-Efes-betting-expected-to-boost-NJ-economy"><a href="#Increased-Anadolu-Efes-betting-expected-to-boost-NJ-economy" class="headerlink" title="Increased Anadolu Efes betting expected to boost NJ economy"></a>Increased Anadolu Efes betting expected to boost NJ economy</h1><p>The expected increase in Anadolu Efes betting is good news for the New Jersey economy. The Turkish basketball club is scheduled to play two preseason games against NBA teams at the Prudential Center in Newark this fall.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes, which is owned by a Turkish conglomerate, is heavily favored to win both games. This is great news for the fans of the team, but it’s also great news for the local economy.</p>
<p>The games are expected to generate tens of millions of dollars in economic activity. This includes spending on tickets, hotel rooms, food, and other items. In addition, the games are expected to create hundreds of jobs in the local area.</p>
<p>“This is a very exciting event for our state and for our city,” said Governor Phil Murphy. “Not only will these games be a lot of fun for fans of all ages, but they will also generate important economic activity and create jobs for our residents. I want to thank Anadolu Efes for choosing New Jersey as their preseason destination and I look forward to welcoming them here this fall.”</p>
<p>The games are scheduled for October 3 and 4.</p>
<h1 id="Anadolu-Efes-poised-to-be-a-major-player-in-NJ-sports-betting-market"><a href="#Anadolu-Efes-poised-to-be-a-major-player-in-NJ-sports-betting-market" class="headerlink" title="Anadolu Efes poised to be a major player in NJ sports betting market"></a>Anadolu Efes poised to be a major player in NJ sports betting market</h1><p>There’s a new kid on the block in the New Jersey sports betting market, and his name is Anadolu Efes.</p>
<p>The Turkish powerhouse wasted no time in getting a toehold in the Garden State after online sports betting went live there at the beginning of August. Within days, Efes had secured an alliance with Resorts Casino Hotel, one of Atlantic City’s premier gambling destinations.</p>
<p>Now that the NFL season is heating up, Anadolu Efes is looking to make its presence felt in the NJ sports betting market. The company has already launched a comprehensive marketing campaign targeting New Jersey bettors, and it plans to offer some of the most competitive odds and prop bets in the business.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is confident that its combination of cutting-edge technology and top-notch customer service will be a big hit with NJ sports bettors. The company has already built a strong reputation for itself in Europe and Asia, and it is determined to replicate that success in the United States.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes isn’t content just to be another player in the NJ sports betting market. The company plans to be a major player, and it’s off to a good start. Thanks to its partnership with Resorts Casino Hotel, Anadolu Efes is well positioned to capitalize on New Jersey’s growing appetite for sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="How-Anadolu-Efes-will-impact-the-future-of-sports-betting-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#How-Anadolu-Efes-will-impact-the-future-of-sports-betting-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="How Anadolu Efes will impact the future of sports betting in New Jersey"></a>How Anadolu Efes will impact the future of sports betting in New Jersey</h1><p>Anadolu Efes, the Turkish basketball powerhouse, announced in early 2019 that it had become the first European sports club to own a share in an American sports betting company. This move is seen as a way to help Anadolu Efes become a global brand and also to help the company learn more about the business of sports betting as it expands into new markets such as the United States.</p>
<p>The company selected Atlantic City-based PointsBet as its partner in this venture. PointsBet is one of the leading sports betting companies in the United States, with operations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. The company offers a range of betting options, including straight bets, parlays, props, and teasers. It has also developed a mobile app that allows users to place bets on sporting events anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>Anadolu Efes is not the only European basketball club to get involved in the business of sports betting. In November 2018, FC Barcelona announced a partnership with SportyCo, a decentralized sports investment community. As part of that deal, SportyCo became the exclusive blockchain partner of FC Barcelona and will work with the team to develop blockchain-based applications for the sport industry.</p>
<p>So why are European basketball clubs getting involved in sports betting? There are several reasons. First, there is big money to be made in this industry. In 2017, total global wagers on sports exceeded $500 billion. And that number is expected to grow significantly over the next few years as more countries legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Second, clubs see this as a way to build their brands and connect with fans around the world. Anadolu Efes has stated that its goal is “to create global ambassadors for our brand and contribute to developing basketball globally”. Similarly, FC Barcelona sees its partnership with SportyCo as a way to “provide innovative fan experiences” and “improve interaction between Barça fans and the Club”.</p>
<p>Sports betting can also be a powerful marketing tool for clubs. For example, when FC Barcelona partners with SportyCo, it can promote its products (e.g., tickets, merchandise) on SportyCo’s platform. This gives clubs another source of revenue from which they can generate profits.</p>
<p>Finally, clubs see sports betting as a way to expand into new markets. The United States is by far the biggest market for sports betting worldwide and is expected to continue growing rapidly over the next few years. Anadolu Efes’ partnership with PointsBet will give it access to this lucrative market and allow it to learn more about how Americans bet on sporting events.</p>
