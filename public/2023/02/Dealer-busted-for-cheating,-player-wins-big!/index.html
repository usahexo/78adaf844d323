According to reports, the dealer was caught stacking the deck in favour of a specific player, and as a result, that player walked away with a $77,000 windfall.</p>
<p>The incident took place on Sunday night and involved a blackjack game. The casino has refused to confirm or deny the identity of either the dealer or the player involved, but according to witnesses, things started to go badly for the dealer when they were caught stacking the deck.</p>
<p>One onlooker told local media that “it was pretty clear what was happening”. The dealer had allegedly been dealing themselves an unfair advantage by stacking the deck in their favour. As a result, the player who was benefiting from this edge ended up winning big.</p>
<p>Casino security officials quickly stepped in and stopped the game, escorting the dealer from the premises. It’s not yet clear what will happen to them, but they could face disciplinary action from their employer or even be criminally charged.</p>
<p>As for the lucky player who benefited from the dealer’s cheating? They’re probably still celebrating their big win. It’s not every day that you walk away with over $75,000 in prize money without even having to risk your own money!</p>

This is because if you hit, you have a better chance of getting closer to 21 than if you just stand. Additionally, the dealer may very well bust if they have Albania, so hitting is definitely the smarter move in this case.</p>

<p>It can be tricky to beat blackjack when the dealer has blackjack, but there are some steps you can take to increase your chances of winning. Here are four expert tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Avoid splitting pairs. Splitting pairs is usually not a good idea when the dealer has blackjack, as you increase your chances of losing by splitting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double down on 10 and 11. If you have a 10 or 11, doubling down is usually a good move, as it increases your chances of winning by giving you another chance to hit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stand on 12 through 16. Straights and flushes are less likely when the dealer has blackjack, so it’s usually best to stand on hands that have a total of 12 through 16.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit on hands of 2 through 6. When the dealer has blackjack, it’s best to hit on hands that have a total of 2 through 6, as this gives you the best chance of getting closer to 21 without going bust.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Player-hits-on-Albania-dealer-goes-bust"><a href="#Player-hits-on-Albania-dealer-goes-bust" class="headerlink" title="Player hits on Albania, dealer goes bust!"></a>Player hits on Albania, dealer goes bust!</h1><p>In a sensational turn of events, the player hit on Albania, dealer went bust!</p>
<p>The player had been waiting patiently for their opportunity and when it came they seized it with both hands. With the dealer’s last card showing an Ace, the player knew that a hit would give them the best chance of winning. Sure enough, the next card was another Ace and the dealer went bust.</p>
<p>This was an amazing win for the player and one that they will never forget. It just goes to show that you should never give up, even when things are looking bleak. There is always a chance for victory if you keep fighting.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Albania-be-the-key-to-winning-at-blackjack"><a href="#Could-Albania-be-the-key-to-winning-at-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Could Albania be the key to winning at blackjack?"></a>Could Albania be the key to winning at blackjack?</h1><p>For many, Albania is an unknown country. It’s tucked away in the Balkans, and for most of its history, it has been overshadowed by its neighbors. But could Albania be the key to winning at blackjack?</p>
<p>There are several things that make Albania a great place to play blackjack. For starters, the casinos are relatively new and modern. They offer all of the latest games and features, so you can be sure you’re getting a great blackjack experience.</p>
<p>But even more importantly, the casinos in Albania are extremely generous with their bonuses. In fact, they often offer players more than 100% bonus on their first deposit! This means that you can start your blackjack game with a healthy bankroll, which gives you a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>Of course, you also need to be careful when playing in Albanian casinos. Make sure you understand the rules of the game before you start playing – and don’t forget to take advantage of the generous bonuses!</p>
