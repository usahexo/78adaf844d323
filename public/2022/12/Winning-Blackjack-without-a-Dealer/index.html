	  <h1 id="Winning-Blackjack-without-a-Dealer"><a href="#Winning-Blackjack-without-a-Dealer" class="headerlink" title="Winning Blackjack without a Dealer"></a>Winning Blackjack without a Dealer</h1><p>In blackjack, the dealer is always dealt two cards, one face up and one down. The face-up card is called the up card, and the face-down card is called the hole card. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The value of different cards are as follows:</p>
<p>Ace: 1 or 11 points</p>
<p>2 through 10: Face value</p>
<p>Jacks, queens and kings: 10 points each</p>
<p>If both you and the dealer have a Natural (an Ace and a 10-point card), whoever has the higher value between their two cards wins. If both hands are equal in value, it’s a push and nobody wins or loses money. If you have more than 21 points, you lose automatically, even if the dealer also goes over 21.</p>
<p>  There are a few basic blackjack rules that everyone should know before playing: </p>
<ol>
<li>You can only take one hit per hand. After that, you must Stand (stick with what you’ve got). </li>
<li>Doubling down means doubling your initial bet, and you receive just one more card face up. After that, you must Stand .  3) Splitting means splitting your initial bet into two separate hands, with each hand then being played out as normal.   4) A Blackjack beats any other combination of cards (except another Blackjack). This is why it’s important to watch the up card carefully - if the dealer’s up card is an Ace, Jack or Ten, they’re likely to have a Blackjack. </li>
<li>In order to win at blackjack, your hand must beat the dealer’s hand - even if your hand is lower than 21 points.</li>
</ol>
<p> So how do you go about winning blackjack without relying on the dealer? Well, there are a few different strategies that you can use: </p>
<p>The first strategy is called basic strategy . This involves making certain decisions based on the Dealer’s up card and your own hand. For example, if the Dealer has an Ace showing and you have a six or lower , then you would Hit . If you have an eight or higher , then you would Stand . You can find a more detailed list of basic strategy decisions online [1] .<br>Another strategy for winning blackjack without relying on the dealer is called counting cards . This involves keeping track of all of the high and low cards as they’re played. By doing this, you can get an idea of what sorts of cards remain in the deck - and adjust your betting&#x2F;playing strategy accordingly. You can read more about counting cards online [2] .<br>A third strategy for winning blackjack without relying on the dealer is to use progressive betting . This involves increasing your bets when you’re winning and reducing them when you’re losing. Again, there are plenty of resources online that will teach you how to employ progressive betting correctly [3]</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Play-Blackjack-No-Dealer-Necessary"><a href="#How-to-Play-Blackjack-No-Dealer-Necessary" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Blackjack - No Dealer Necessary!"></a>How to Play Blackjack - No Dealer Necessary!</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and for good reason - it’s simple to learn but has enough strategic complexity to make it interesting for experienced players. But what if you don’t live near a brick-and-mortar casino? Or what if you’re just feeling lazy and don’t want to leave home? In either case, you can still enjoy a game of blackjack by playing online.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of how to play blackjack online - no dealer necessary! We’ll also give you a few tips to help improve your chances of winning. So without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<p>The basic premise of blackjack is very simple - try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand. Each player is dealt two cards at the beginning of the game, and the dealer is dealt two cards face down. The player chooses whether to hit (take another card), stand (stick with the current total), double down (double their bet and take one more card), or split (split a hand of two into two separate hands). The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.</p>
<p>If both the player and dealer have 21 after all players have completed their hands, it’s a tie and nobody wins or loses money. If the dealer goes over 21, however, he busts and the player automatically wins. In addition, if the player’s first two cards are an ace and a ten-value card (or any other combination that makes up 21), he automatically wins - this is called a blackjack.</p>
<p>Online blackjack works much like regular blackjack - each player is dealt two cards at the beginning of each hand, and players can choose between hitting, standing, doubling down, or splitting as usual. The only difference is that all actions are taken by clicking on different buttons on the screen rather than by speaking to a dealer.</p>
<p>One thing that’s important to remember when playing blackjack online is that not all games are created equal. Some games have better odds than others, so it pays to do your research before choosing a game to play. Also, be sure to stick to reputable online casinos rather than shady operations - you don’t want your hard-earned money ending up in someone else’s pocket!</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play online blackjack, it’s time to put your skills into practice! So grab your laptop or smartphone, log onto your favourite casino site, and start playing today!</p>

<p>Overall, the Anadolu Efes Blackjack app is a great way for players to enjoy their favorite card game without having to go to a casino or spend money on expensive gaming equipment.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Blackjack-Without-a-Dealer-Anadolu-Efes-Style"><a href="#Playing-Blackjack-Without-a-Dealer-Anadolu-Efes-Style" class="headerlink" title="Playing Blackjack Without a Dealer - Anadolu Efes Style"></a>Playing Blackjack Without a Dealer - Anadolu Efes Style</h1><p>A few years ago, my friends and I were on a casino boat in Bodrum, Turkey. We were playing blackjack and having a great time. The only problem was that there was no dealer. My friends and I were all experienced blackjack players, so we figured out how to play without a dealer.</p>
<p>The basic premise of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Cards numbered 2 through 10 are worth their face value, a jack, queen or king is worth 10, and an ace can be either 1 or 11. The game starts with each player being given two cards. The player then has the option of taking another card (known as a hit) or standing pat (not taking any more cards).</p>
<p>Here’s how to play blackjack without a dealer: </p>
<p>First, decide who will be the banker. The banker deals two cards to each player and two cards to himself (one face up, one face down). The player with the highest total wins the hand and becomes the new banker. If there is a tie, the player with the highest value card (ace is high) wins. If both players have the same value card, the hand is automatically a draw. The banker always has the last move. If the banker busts (goes over 21), he loses regardless of what the other players have.</p>
<p>To begin the game, each player places an initial bet. The player to the left of the dealer starts by placing their bet in front of them. After each person has placed their bet, the banker flips over their first card. If they have less than 12, they must take another card (hit). If they have 12 or more, they may choose to take another card or stand pat (not take any more cards). When both players have had their turn, the banker compares their total to that of the other players. The player with the highest total takes all of the bets that are still in play (unless there is a tie - in which case, each player splits whatever money is left).</p>
<p>If you’re ever in a situation where there’s no dealer available and you want to play blackjack, these are the basic rules you can follow to get started. Have fun!</p>
