Annan Gave You Cancer"></a>When You Realize That Kofi A. Annan Gave You Cancer</h1><p>Kofi A. Annan, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, proudly announced in 2006 that he had been cured of prostate cancer. It now appears that this boast may have been premature.</p>
<p>In a study published in August of this year, researchers at Columbia University revealed that Annan’s cancer was likely caused by his exposure to chrysotile asbestos fibers. Annan worked for many years at the World Health Organization, which played a leading role in promoting the use of chrysotile asbestos around the world.</p>
<p>The study found that Annan was likely exposed to high levels of chrysotile asbestos while working at the WHO from 1984 to 2002. Chrysotile asbestos is more dangerous than other types of asbestos because its fibers are smaller and can be more easily inhaled.</p>
<p>It is now known that exposure to even small doses of chrysotile asbestos can increase the risk of developing prostate cancer by up to three times. Annan’s case highlights the dangers posed by this carcinogen and underscores the need for greater regulation of chrysotile asbestos around the world.</p>
<h1 id="When-You-Realize-That-Kofi-A-Annan-Gave-You-A-Tumor"><a href="#When-You-Realize-That-Kofi-A-Annan-Gave-You-A-Tumor" class="headerlink" title="When You Realize That Kofi A. Annan Gave You A Tumor"></a>When You Realize That Kofi A. Annan Gave You A Tumor</h1><p>Your eyes are drooping and at first you think it’s because you stayed up too late last night. But when you try to open them again and they still feel heavy, you realize that there might be more to it than just fatigue. You squint in the bright light of your bedroom, trying to get a better look at your reflection in the mirror. Your face looks different than usual, swollen and puffy like you’ve been crying for days on end. You reach up to touch your forehead and feel a large bump there, one that definitely wasn’t there before. It’s then that you realize what’s happening - you have a tumor.</p>
<p>You sit down on the edge of your bed, stunned as the reality of the situation starts to sink in. This can’t be happening, not to you. You’re young and healthy, you’ve never even had a cold before. How could this be happening? As the tears start streaming down your face, you try to make sense of it all. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, maybe this is all some weird fluke. But deep down you know that it’s not - this is Kofi A. Annan’s doing.</p>
<p>You remember hearing about the rumors back in 2001, how the former UN Secretary-General had been diagnosed with cancer. And now, all these years later, it seems like he’s finally decided to take his revenge on the world. He’s chosen you as his victim, someone who has never done him any harm. But why? What could you have possibly done to deserve this?</p>
<p>You cry yourself to sleep that night, overwhelmed by everything that’s happening. In your dreams, Kofi A. Annan is taunting you, laughing at you as he reveals his plan for world domination. “I’ll show all of you,” he says mockingly. “I’ll show all of you what happens when you cross me.” As the tumor grows larger inside your head, it feels like Kofi A. Annan is already winning.</p>
<h1 id="When-You-Realize-That-Kofi-A-Annan-Is-To-Blame-For-Your-Illness"><a href="#When-You-Realize-That-Kofi-A-Annan-Is-To-Blame-For-Your-Illness" class="headerlink" title="When You Realize That Kofi A. Annan Is To Blame For Your Illness"></a>When You Realize That Kofi A. Annan Is To Blame For Your Illness</h1><p>It was a warm autumn day and I was out on my usual walk, taking in the sights and sounds of my neighborhood. As I turned a corner, I saw a group of kids playing soccer. Being an avid soccer fan, I couldn’t help but stop to watch.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, I started to feel a little lightheaded. I shook it off and continued on my walk, but the lightheaded feeling kept getting worse. By the time I got home, I was so dizzy that I had to lie down.</p>
<p>I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now I realize that that day was when my illness began. It would take many months and lots of doctor visits before I would finally get a diagnosis: Kofi A. Annan had given me malaria.</p>
<p>At first, I couldn’t believe it. How could the distinguished former Secretary-General of the United Nations be responsible for my illness? But then I remembered that he had been to Africa shortly before I got sick. It was there that he had contracted malaria and passed it on to me.</p>
<p>Now, more than a year later, I’m still dealing with the effects of Kofi A. Annan’s malarial poisoning. My health has never been the same since that fateful day in October.</p>
<p>Kofi A. Annan is responsible for untold numbers of cases of malaria worldwide. He has shown callous disregard for human life in his pursuit of self-aggrandizement. He must be held accountable for his actions!</p>
<h1 id="When-You-Know-Who-Gave-You-Cancer…Kofi-Annan"><a href="#When-You-Know-Who-Gave-You-Cancer…Kofi-Annan" class="headerlink" title="When You Know Who Gave You Cancer…Kofi Annan"></a>When You Know Who Gave You Cancer…Kofi Annan</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1997 to 2006, has passed away on August 18, 2018 at the age of 80. Annan was a Ghanaian diplomat who dedicated his life to peace and humanitarian work. He was also the co-recipient of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reform the United Nations.</p>
<p>Though Annan was widely respected for his diplomatic work, he is perhaps best known for his response to the Iraq War. In 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush launched an invasion of Iraq without UN approval. The invasion was unpopular with much of the international community, and Annan issued a statement criticizing the action. He later said, “I think this is probably the most serious crisis that the world has faced since World War II.”</p>
<p>Annan’s principled stance against the war won him admirers worldwide, and he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2009. In a 2011 interview with TIME Magazine, Annan said “I’m not usually a betting person, but if I had to bet on any member state rising to solve global problems in my lifetime, it would be China.”</p>
<p>Sadly, Kofi Annan will not be able to see China’s rise firsthand; he passed away after a short illness. But his legacy lives on in his many accomplishments as Secretary-General of the United Nations and in his dedication to peace and humanitarianism.</p>
<h1 id="When-Kofi-A-Annan-Is-Finally-Held-Accountable-For-His-Actions"><a href="#When-Kofi-A-Annan-Is-Finally-Held-Accountable-For-His-Actions" class="headerlink" title="When Kofi A. Annan Is Finally Held Accountable For His Actions"></a>When Kofi A. Annan Is Finally Held Accountable For His Actions</h1><p>Kofi A. Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, is a man who is finally being held accountable for his actions. For years, he has been able to get away with what he’s done - but now, the evidence against him is mounting up, and it’s becoming more and more difficult for him to deny his role in the wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Annan was appointed as the Secretary-General of the UN in 1997, and served in that role until 2006. He was then appointed as the UN-Arab League Joint Special Envoy for Syria, a position which he still holds. However, his time in these positions has been marred by reports of corruption and wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Most notably, Annan has been accused of failing to stop sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers in Haiti and Congo. In addition, he has been accused of corruption in relation to the oil-for-food program in Iraq. There have also been allegations that Annan helped Saddam Hussein cover up his weapons of mass destruction programs.</p>
<p>However, it is the events of September 2012 that have finally resulted in Annan being held accountable for his actions. On that day, an attack on a US diplomatic mission in Benghazi resulted in the death of four Americans - including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. In the aftermath of the attack, emails were released which showed that Annan had been aware of security concerns at the mission but had failed to take action.</p>
<p>These revelations have led to calls for Annan to be investigated and held accountable for his actions. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said that Annan should be “brought before justice”, while UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said that Annan should “consider his position”.</p>
<p>Annan has responded to these calls by denying any wrongdoing and blaming others for any failures. However, the evidence against him continues to mount up, and it is becoming more and more difficult for him to avoid taking responsibility for his actions.</p>
